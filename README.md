Computer Science Knowledge Network

How are computer science fields/technologies organized? What are research fields/technologies are there ? How are they interconnected ?

The aim of this project is to create a regularly updated map about every computer science field, subfield , new technolgy, programming language, framework, concept, pattern, protocol, technique, acrchitecture style. The target is NOT to build a knoweldge base, it is to build the knowledge network, that shows the hirarchy of things and how they are related, in other words, it will help anyone to get the big picture of a field or a topic.

Such a map will help everyone to be uptodate with what is happening in the IT/Computer Science field. Also, it will help shaping the learning path for anyone who wants to learn a new field or technology. For example, if you are a "Security" student. then you can clearly see what security models, algorithms, technologies exist. you can also know exactly what to learn and what to skip. 

The information could be represented in multipel forms. one form is to use a mind map to show the hirearchy and the connections.

you can open the file "MindMup.mup"  using https://www.mindmup.com. go to file , open/import, import from github. 
why mindmup:
1- easy to use and free
2- map is in JSON format. so we can modify the map easily or switch the mind map software. 
3- you can search the map using "Ctrl+F"
